/**
 * The contract package at a glance, above its documents.
 *
 * It used to be four stat tiles and two donuts. The tiles stated documents, approved and
 * open; the status donut then stated the same three numbers again in a different visual
 * language a few inches away, which teaches a reader that the summary is padding. Each
 * number is stated once now.
 *
 * Two figures, deliberately different shapes: a ring for what the package is made of, a bar
 * for how far along it is. Both sit inside `.viz`, which owns the --series-N variables the
 * donut draws from.
