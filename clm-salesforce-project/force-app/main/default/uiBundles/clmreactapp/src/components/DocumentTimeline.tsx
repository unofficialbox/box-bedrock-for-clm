/**
 * What has happened to this contract's documents, newest first.
 *
 * Every entry is something Box actually recorded: a document changed, on a date, by a
 * named person. Approval is shown as the state that change left the document in, not as a
 * separate dated event -- because it is not one. `clmDocument` carries an approval status
 * but no approval timestamp and no approver, so a line reading "Approved by X on Y" would
 * be invented. A timeline that quietly fabricates half its entries is worse than one that
 * shows fewer.
 *
 * The counterparty sees this too, so it lists only documents that survived the redline
 * filter -- it is built from the same array the table renders, not from a second fetch.
