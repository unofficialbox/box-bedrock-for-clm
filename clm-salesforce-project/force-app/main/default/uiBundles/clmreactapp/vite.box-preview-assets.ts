/**
 * Serves Box Content Preview's side-car assets from this app's own origin.
 *
 * The renderer is bundled from npm rather than fetched from the Box CDN, because an
 * Experience Cloud site sends `script-src 'self'` and Salesforce's CSP Trusted Sites have
 * no script-src directive to extend. Bundling solves the script, but preview still
 * resolves a few files at runtime against `options.location.staticBaseURI`, which it
 * normally derives from its own `<script>` tag. There is no such tag now, so the value is
 * `undefined` and preview requests `undefinedexif/exif.min.js`. The app passes an explicit
 * `staticBaseURI` (see `boxPreviewRuntime`) and this plugin puts the files there.
 *
 * Only `exif/` is copied. pdf.js itself is bundled into the npm build -- unlike the CDN
 * build, which loads it from `third-party/doc/` -- and the remaining side-cars are for
 * viewers this workspace does not use: `third-party/` is 20MB of Shaka players and 3D
 * model geometry, and `cmaps/` is 1.6MB of CJK encodings across ~330 files, which would
 * become ~330 more components on every UI bundle deploy.
